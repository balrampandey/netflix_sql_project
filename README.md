## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analytical study of Netflix's content library using SQL-based data analysis techniques. The primary objective is to extract actionable business insights from Netflix's movies and TV shows dataset to support strategic decision-making and content optimization initiatives.

## Project Objectives

The analysis addresses critical business questions to understand Netflix's content landscape, including:

- **Content Distribution Analysis:** Examining the composition of movies versus TV shows in Netflix's catalog
- **Geographic Content Mapping:** Identifying content production patterns across different countries
- **Temporal Trend Analysis:** Understanding content release patterns and historical growth trends
- **Genre and Category Performance:** Analyzing popular content categories and their market performance
- **Content Maturity Profiling:** Evaluating content ratings and target audience demographics
- **Quality Assessment Metrics:** Investigating content duration, cast diversity, and production characteristics

## Business Intelligence Framework

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Content volume by type and release year
- Geographic distribution of content production
- Genre popularity and market penetration
- Content rating distribution and audience targeting
- Production timeline and release frequency metrics

### Analytical Techniques Employed
- Complex SQL queries with subquery operations
- Aggregate functions for statistical analysis
- Window functions for ranking and trend analysis
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex data transformations
- Date/time analysis for temporal pattern recognition

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balrampandey/netflix-sql-database.git
cd netflix-sql-database
```

2. Create a PostgreSQL database:
```sql

## üìã Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
- **Dataset Link:** [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balrampanday/data-netflix)

## üìä Business Problems and Solutions

### Q.1 Count of titles by type & year
**Business Question:** "How fast are we adding Movies vs TV Shows YoY?"

```sql
SELECT 
    release_year,
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS title_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1 DESC,2;
```

### Q.2 Top-10 countries with most titles
**Business Question:** "Which markets are we strongest in?"

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(TRIM(country), ',')) AS single_country,
    COUNT(*) AS titles_count
FROM netflix
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY single_country
ORDER BY titles_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Q.3 Titles added in last 30 days
**Business Question:** "What's fresh on the platform?"

```sql
SELECT 
    title,
    type,
    date_added
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Q.4 All movies released between 2015-2020 with rating > 8
**Business Question:** "Identify evergreen catalog for licensing negotiations."

```sql
SELECT 
    title, 
    release_year, 
    rating
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
    AND release_year BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020
    AND rating IN ('TV-MA','R','PG-13');
```

### Q.5 Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows
**Business Question:** "Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix."

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```
