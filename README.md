# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Database

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analytical study of Netflix's content library using SQL-based data analysis techniques. The primary objective is to extract actionable business insights from Netflix's movies and TV shows dataset to support strategic decision-making and content optimization initiatives.

## Project Objectives
The analysis addresses critical business questions to understand Netflix's content landscape, including:
**1-Content Distribution Analysis:** Examining the composition of movies versus TV shows in Netflix's catalog.
**2-Geographic Content Mapping:**Identifying content production patterns across different countries.
**3-Temporal Trend Analysis:**Understanding content release patterns and historical growth trends.
**4-Genre and Category Performance:**Analyzing popular content categories and their market performance.
**5-Content Maturity Profiling:**Evaluating content ratings and target audience demographics.
**6-Quality Assessment Metrics:**Investigating content duration, cast diversity, and production characteristics.
## Business Intelligence Framework
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
*Content volume by type and release year
*Geographic distribution of content production
*Genre popularity and market penetration
*Content rating distribution and audience targeting
*Production timeline and release frequency metrics
##Analytical Techniques Employed
*Complex SQL queries with subquery operations
*Aggregate functions for statistical analysis
*Window functions for ranking and trend analysis
*Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex data transformations
*Date/time analysis for temporal pattern recognition

```

## Q.2- Top-10 countries with most titles
 **Business:** ‚ÄúWhich markets are we strongest in?‚Äù
 
```sql

	FROM   netflix
	WHERE  country IS NOT NULL
	GROUP  BY single_country,title
